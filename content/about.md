I work as the Principal Architect for Malwarebytes, helping our team fight computer malware and other really bad stuff.  I have been coding as far as I remember, about 30+ years ago. During my career I have been fortunate to work with many technologies, ranging from development environments based on MS-DOS, such as Clipper, DBase III+, Pascal, C/C++, and with most all of the great Windows based technologies in the years 1990's and 2000's, like Visual Basic, Visual C++, Borland Delphi, Borland C++, Kylix, Microsoft .NET C#. (Yeah I have missed the Java boat, fortunately)

For the last 10 years or so, I have been working mostly on the Mac OS X, developing software using Ruby on Rails, Objective-C and Swift, and Golang (Go) acting as an architect for very large web-based systems and mobile applications.

This is my new spot to share my thoughts and findings about programming and interesting tidbits of technology.

Thanks,
